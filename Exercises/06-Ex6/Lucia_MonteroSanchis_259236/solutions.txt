# Trace 3: Traceroute
## Briefly describe how the traceroute tool works including which network protocols are in use.

Traceroute sends a sequence of (by default) UDP packets with an increasing TTL value, starting with 1 (and increasing by 1). Every time one of these packets reaches a router, the TTL of the packet decreases by 1. When the TTL value of a packet reaches 0, the router drops it and returns the ICMP error message **ICMP Time Exceeded** back to the source. As a result, the source receives an **ICMP Time Exceeded** message from each of the routers that packets traverse until reaching the destination.

## Give the source IP address that issued the traceroute command and the destination IP address.

Source IP: 192.168.0.100
Destination IP: 74.125.225.46

## List the IP addresses on the route between source and destination (meaning:
do not include the IP addresses of the source and destination).
